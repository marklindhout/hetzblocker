# Hetzblocker

Hetzblocker is a browser extension for Chrome, Chromium and Firefox. It blocks inflammatory media outlets, their publishers, and associated sites.

Media that is just a clickbaited, confusing, low-effort advertisement lure?

“_Ain't nobody got time for that!_”

## Features

 - Blocks all requests to inflammatory media and platforms. For example Axel Springer, De Telegraaf Media Groep, and many more.
 - Saves you the stress you build up from reading nonsensical articles.
 - Bonus: Protects you from seeing truely muddleheaded comment sections on these sites.
 - Indicates and disables links to blocked sites everywhere — Handy for search results, source reference sections, etc.

For those of you who would like to help out in a more direct manner: I’m still looking for people to help maintain the block list or add translations. If you’d like to join the party, please drop me a line on GitHub or send me an email.

## Developing the browser extension

See [`README.md`](../README.md) in the root of the repository.

## Thanks

This extension is heavily inspired by [autinerd’s hosts file](https://github.com/autinerd/anti-axelspringer-hosts), plus [revengeday](https://github.com/revengeday)’s and [rleh](https://github.com/rleh)’s work on browser extensions.

Thanks guys!
