For those of you who would like to help out in a more direct manner: I’m still looking for people to help maintain the block list or add translations. If you’d like to join the party, please drop me a line on GitHub or send me an email.

## Developing the browser extension

See [`README.md`](https://github.com/marklindhout/hetzblocker/blob/master/README.md) in the root of the repository.

## Thanks

This extension is heavily inspired by [autinerd’s hosts file](https://github.com/autinerd/anti-axelspringer-hosts), plus [revengeday](https://github.com/revengeday)’s and [rleh](https://github.com/rleh)’s work on browser extensions.

Thanks guys!
